**Executive Summary**

As a student in the Computer Engineering Technology program, I will be
integrating the knowledge and skills I have learned from our program into this
Internet of Things themed capstone project. This proposal requests the approval
to build the hardware portion that will connect to a database as well as to a
mobile device application. The internet connected hardware will include a custom
PCB with sensors and /or actuators for detecting car collision and save the
captured image/video in a black box The database will store the timestamp and
the folder location of the video that were saved in the blackbox. The mobile
device functionality will include notifying the car owner of an accident
happening and if possible, an image or video capture of the accident and will be
further detailed in the mobile application proposal. I will be collaborating
with the following company/department \_____________. In the winter semester I
plan to form a group with the following students, who are also building similar
hardware this term and working on the mobile application with Jerome Aganon and
Jaewoong Kang. The hardware will be completed in CENG 317 Hardware Production
Techniques independently and the application will be completed in CENG 319
Software Project. These will be integrated together in the subsequent term in
CENG 355 Computer Systems Project as a member of a 2 or 3 student group.

**Background**

The problem solved by project is to not to prevent any accident but to get
evidence if an accident happened. Having a dash cam does not mean that if an
accident happened there would be footage of what happened. Sometimes, accident
happens on the side or back of the car. In the event that such thing happened,
the people will rely on the story of a witness or the victims. Sometimes the
people will try to change their story in order for them to get away with it. If
such thing happens, the police will have to look around and see if a CCTV has
captured the accident.

The first journal that we found presents “ the approach to use smartphones as a
multi sensor platform in a field operational test respectively a naturalistic
driving study”. [@6758745]

The second journal talks about optical camera used for vehicles. [@7801077]

For the last journal, it then talks about inevitable accidents that can happen
with motorcycles and automobiles. [@7410053]

I have searched for prior art via Humber’s IEEE subscription selecting “My
Subscribed Content”[1] and have found and read [2] which provides insight into
similar efforts.

In the Computer Engineering Technology program we have learned about the
following topics from the respective relevant courses:

-   Java Docs from CENG 212 Programming Techniques In Java

-   Construction of circuits from CENG 215 Digital And Interfacing Systems,

-   Rapid application development and Gantt charts from CENG 216 Intro to
    Software Engineering,

-   Micro computing from CENG 252 Embedded Systems,

-   SQL from CENG 254 Database With Java,

-   Web access of databases from CENG 256 Internet Scripting; and,

-   Wireless protocols such as 802.11 from TECH152 Telecom Networks.

This knowledge and skill set will enable me to build the subsystems and
integrate them together as my capstone project.

**Methodology**

This proposal is assigned in the first week of class and is due at the beginning
of class in the second week of the fall semester. My coursework will focus on
the first two of the 3 phases of this project: Phase 1 Hardware build. Phase 2
System integration. Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers.

Phase 1 Hardware build

The hardware build will be completed in the fall term. It will fit within the
CENG Project maximum dimensions of 12 13/16" x 6" x 2 7/8" (32.5cm x 15.25cm x
7.25cm) which represents the space below the tray in the parts kit. The highest
AC voltage that will be used is 16Vrms from a wall adaptor from which +/- 15V or
as high as 45 VDC can be obtained. Maximum power consumption will be 20 Watts.

Phase 2 System integration

The system integration will be completed in the fall term.

Phase 3 Demonstration to future employers

This project will showcase the knowledge and skills that I have learned to
potential employers.

The tables below provide rough effort and non-labour estimates respectively for
each phase. A Gantt chart will be added by week 3 to provide more project
schedule details and a more complete budget will be added by week 4. It is
important to start tasks as soon as possible to be able to meet deadlines.

**Concluding remarks**

This proposal presents a plan for providing an IoT solution for mini computer
and black box for car. This is an opportunity to integrate the knowledge and
skills developed in our program to create a collaborative IoT capstone project
demonstrating my ability to learn how to support projects such as the initiative
described by [3]. I request approval of this project.

1. Introduction
-----------------



2. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
-----------------------------------------------



2.1 Technology Introduction
-----------------------------------------------

####2.1.1 Purpose

The purpose of our software is to provide an automated service for drivers that notifies them of any accidents or damages that may have occurred to their car. With the use of mobile application, the owner will have the data of the location and video feed of the accident. It will also serve as a data storage regarding the accident for the owner. They will be able to input additional information about the driver, the car, as well as information needed for the insurance company. A website will be available for the user to register an account for them to use the mobile application.

####2.1.2 Product Overview

The product will have piezo vibration sensors that will detect if there are any collisions detected. Raspberry Pi camera module will also be used to record video.

####2.1.3 Targeted Audience Group:

Our target audience is any person that has a car and insurance company for they will be able to use the video feed as a proof of an incident.



2.2 Product Information
----------------------------------------------

####2.2.1 Main Functionality

The main functionality of our system is to provide an incident report on user's mobile device in case of an accident. Information that the user saves on the application can then be used by them for their insurance company. The hardware will provide the video feed as well as the coordinates of the report.


####2.2.2 Extra Requirements

Internet connection is needed for the hardware device for it to be able to send the report, video and location, to the database. Implementation of battery powered raspberry pi will also be needed for it to be placed inside the car. (Jerome please confirm)

####2.2.3 Best Performance

To achieve best performance of the product, we recommend sharing a stable wifi internet connection with the device.


2.3 Overall Description
-----------------------------------------

####2.3.1 System Interface

System interface for our project includes: collision detector hardware, database server, and mobile application. If an accident is detected from the hardware, it sends an accident report to the server. The user through the use of mobile application in which he/she can retrieve the video file and location of the accident can then access this report. The user will also be able to delete the report (in case of false report), as well as add information to the report.

####2.3.2 Database

We are going to use the GoDaddy's database to store the information about the user, the accident, the driver they had an accident with and the car that the other driver was using. For the user infomration, we are going to store the username password and its user's id. For the password, we are going to encrypt the user's password using MD5 to protect the password just in case someone tries to hack our system. In accident table, we are going to the store the reporrtId, incident date, video name, longitude and latitude. In the driver table, we are going to store the other driver's license, first name,, last name, gender and insurance number.  In the car's table, we are goint ot store the other driver' car information such as plate number, brand, model and the year it was manufactured. 


####2.3.3 Hardware

Our hardware is a collision detector. Once the car has start up, the hardware will start running immediately. It will start recording as soon as it is start up. It will have loop and lock functionality. With the loop functionality, the hardware will replace the old video with a new video, which prevents the hardware from using too much memory. The lock functionality will lock up the video file if the hardware detects any collision. It will lock up the file until the hard is connected to the Internet. Once it is connected, it will upload the file to the server and store the date that the video was captured, the location and the name of the video.

####2.3.4 Mobile Application

Our mobile application is called AutAcc Report and is exclusive to Android. With the mobile app, the user is able to retrieve any incident related to the user. Once it is able to retrieve an incident report, the user will be able to add more information about the driver that he/she had an accident with and the car he/she was using.  The application has playback functionality where it can watch the video that was captured during the incident.  It also has map functionality where it will pinpoint the exact location of the incident by using Google map. The mobile app also has functionality where the user can contact his/her insurance agent where he/she can report the incident. Since
